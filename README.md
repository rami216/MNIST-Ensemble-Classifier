# MNIST-Ensemble-Classifier
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on building and evaluating ensemble classifiers to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the use of various classifiers like Random Forest, Extra-Trees, SVM, and MLP, combined using a VotingClassifier for improved accuracy.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). The primary goal of this project is to:
- Train multiple classifiers individually on the dataset.
- Combine them using a VotingClassifier to boost performance.
- Compare the performance of individual classifiers and the ensemble model.
